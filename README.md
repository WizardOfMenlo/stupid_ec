# Stupid EC
A collection of tools and algorithms related to elliptic curve cryptography, implemented in the most stupid way possible.

A few of the usual warnings are in order:
1. If anything here is constant time, that is entirely by accident
2. Anything can and will break
3. If you attempt to use a library called stupid EC in anything security critical, well then you kind of deserve what's coming to you
